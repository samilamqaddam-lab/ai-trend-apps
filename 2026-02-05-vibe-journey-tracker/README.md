# 🎢 Vibe Coding Journey Tracker

An interactive tracker that shows where you are on the emotional rollercoaster from "vibe coder" to "agentic engineer."

## The Trend

**Date:** February 5, 2026  
**Source:** Twitter/X trending discussions

Today marks the **1-year anniversary** of Andrej Karpathy coining the term "vibe coding." In his anniversary retrospective, he proposed a new term for the evolution: **"Agentic Engineering"**.

### Viral Tweet That Inspired This

> "Vibe coding reality:
> 
> Hour 1: This is magic, shipping in days  
> Hour 3: Why is auth broken again  
> Hour 5: Cursor just suggested I rewrite the entire app again"

> — @iPritamX

And from Karpathy's original 2025 tweet:

> "There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding', where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists."

## Why This Matters

The transition from "vibe coding" to "agentic engineering" isn't just a rebrand—it's a maturity model. Most developers go through these stages:

1. **Discovery**: AI coding feels like magic
2. **Struggle**: Reality hits, bugs appear
3. **Integration**: Learning to work *with* AI as a tool
4. **Mastery**: Proper oversight, tests, architecture

This tracker gamifies that journey and helps developers recognize where they are.
